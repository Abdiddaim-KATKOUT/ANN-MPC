# *Folders Description*
* `Dataset`: contains the dataset and its description, which has been used for training and testing the proposed ANN-based control scheme. These data, which have been collected by MPC, comprises 70 samples, which are divided into 60 samples for specific resistive loads, whereas only 10 samples represent the case where the inverter is directly fed a non-linear load (i.e., diode-bridge rectifier). For each sample, the simulation is run, using MPC2, under various operating conditions such as simulation time (i.e, number of output voltage cycles), sampling time $T_s$, filter capacitor C, filter inductance L, DC-link voltage Vdc, and reference voltage. More details about each sample are given in Dataset.pdf.
